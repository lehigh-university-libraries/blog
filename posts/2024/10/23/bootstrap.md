Welcome to the [Lehigh University Libraries Technology Team](https://lts.lehigh.edu/about/lts-staff-directory?profile_team[313]=313) blog!

## Scope of the blog

This "blog" will be populated by a technical team, so many of these blog entries may look more like an [architectural decision record (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) for our different services. Given that we'll only be writing about technical/architectural decisions that are significant AND have a possible broader audience, blog posts may come out on a slower cadence than you may expect.

## Attribution

Thanks to Lehigh's [Web &amp; Mobile Services team](https://lts.lehigh.edu/about/lts-staff-directory?profile_team%5B292%5D=292) for the easy to implement header/footer theme files we're using for this site.
